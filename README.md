# Inventory

This is an React based app that keeps track of items in the pantry, fridge, and anywhere else in a home or a storage unit. This is to aid with figuring out what is needed when going shopping, not buying the same item when in stock, and keep track of waste.

## To get started

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## In developer mode (with HMR

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
